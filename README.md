# Welcome

Hello.  I’m Douglas. I manufacture and distribute good ideas. I'm into technology, community building, and philosophical inquiry. I am curious about understanding systems— from simple frameworks to cosmic orders—and strive to understand how things work and create efficiencies that enhance ourselves and our environment.

## About Me

I enjoy creating experiences where technology extends beyond its conventional borders. My interests lie in pushing the boundaries of what's possible, turning imaginative ideas into tangible outcomes.
